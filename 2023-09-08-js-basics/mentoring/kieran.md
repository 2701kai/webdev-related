> Sorry, I'm paraphrasing, and I don't even have Tourette's. But why not, as our disgusting far-right politicians often say here: 'you should still be allowed to say that in Germany...' - exactly. So here I go: thank you for another hour of perfect edutainment. Once again, I was able to broaden my horizon by 3 micrometers, had never heard of 'King Solomon's Mines,' and therefore am particularly delighted by how and in what captivating manner you were able to bring new knowledge to the class. I really love discovering new things and am even more excited about your teaching approach. Some people seem to be born for it. KIERAN (TM) spontaneously comes to mind. Thank you, have a peeeerfect weekend!

> How many euphemisms can one use in ESL before it starts to feel weird or carries a 'tinder style' awkward connotation? Who cares, well, best-human-ever-Antje might, Iâ€™ll have some explaining to do.. but whatever and certainly not really me, because my, wait: OUR enthusiasm as a class is genuine for KIERAN (TM). We are very happy and appreciate Lingoda's flexibility in giving us the BEST upon request. Thank you, Lingoda, thank you Kieran!

> As a collective class, we are deeply appreciative of Kieran's pedagogical approach. We hope that many will have the privilege to experience his truly engaging educational methods after us (and certainly not instead of us!). His approach is simply: new, revolutionary, engaging, and essentially the epitome of 'Edutainment.' This is how education should be: one enjoys it to the utmost, shares laughter, and learns a great deal without it ever feeling burdensome. Thank you, Kieran; we eagerly anticipate our upcoming lessons!

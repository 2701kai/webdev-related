## Node vs Element

​
Generally when you are working with the DOM you will be working with elements since most often you want to interact with HTML elements. Nodes are the more generic version of an element. A node could be an HTML element, but it could also be anything else in an HTML document, such as text or comments
​

## DOM Traversal

​
DOM Traversal is the process of navigating through the DOM tree and selecting an element based on its relationship to another element. There are many different ways to traverse the DOM, but the most common ways are:
​

- **parentElement**: returns the parent element of the specified element
- **children**: returns a collection of an element's child elements
- **nextElementSibling**: returns the element immediately following the specified element
- **previousElementSibling**: returns the element immediately before the specified element
- **firstElementChild**: returns the first child element of the specified element
- **lastElementChild**: returns the last child element of the specified element
- **childElementCount**: returns the number of child elements of the specified element

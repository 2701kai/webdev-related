# .filter, .splice, .push

### array.filter():

The "array.filter" method is used to create a new array containing elements from the original array that pass a certain condition or criteria.
It takes a callback function as an argument, which is executed for each element in the array.
The callback function should return a boolean value representing whether the element should be included in the new array or not.
The "array.filter" method does not modify the original array, but returns a new array with the filtered elements.
Example usage:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
2const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0);
3console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4]
```

### array.splice():

The "array.splice" method is used to add or remove elements from an array at a specific index.
It can take multiple arguments, including the start index, the number of elements to remove, and elements to add.
The "array.splice" method modifies the original array by removing or replacing elements and returns the removed elements as a new array.
Example usage:

```javascript
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
const removedFruits = fruits.splice(1, 1, "orange", "kiwi");

console.log(fruits); // Output: ["apple", "orange", "kiwi", "cherry"]
console.log(removedFruits); // Output: ["banana"]
```

### array.push():

The "array.push" method is used to add one or more elements to the end of an array.
It takes one or more arguments representing the elements to be added.
The "array.push" method modifies the original array and returns the new length of the array.
Example usage:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const newLength = numbers.push(4, 5);

console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(newLength); // Output: 5
```

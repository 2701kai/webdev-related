The method `.slice()` is a built-in JavaScript method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array or string into a new array or string object. In the context of the provided code, it's being used on a string.

Let's break down the usage of `date.slice(3, 5)`:

- **Starting Index (3)**: The first argument to the `slice` method (3 in this case) specifies the starting index from which the slicing should begin. Remember, indices in JavaScript are 0-based, so the index 3 refers to the 4th character in the string, which is the first character of the month section of the date string "21/07/1993," i.e., '0'.

- **Ending Index (5 but not inclusive)**: The second argument to the `slice` method (5 in this instance) specifies the index at which the slicing should stop. Importantly, this index is not inclusive, meaning the slice will capture up to but not including the character at this index. In the date string "21/07/1993," the index 5 refers to the second character of the month, i.e., '7'.

Given this, `date.slice(3, 5)` will extract the characters starting from the 4th character up to (but not including) the character at the 6th position, resulting in the substring '07'.

```js
let month = date.slice(3, 5);
```

The variable `month` will have the value '07', which represents the month in the given date string.

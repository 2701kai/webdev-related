# `readline-sync` in Node.js

`readline-sync` is a library in Node.js that allows developers to interact with users via the command line in a synchronous manner. Unlike the built-in `readline` module of Node.js, which is asynchronous, `readline-sync` blocks the event loop to get input, ensuring that the code execution waits until the user provides the necessary input.

## Installation

To use `readline-sync`, you first need to install it using npm (Node.js package manager):

```bash
npm install readline-sync
```

## Usage

To use `readline-sync`, you first need to import it into your code:

---

##### CoPilot:

```javascript
const readlineSync = require("readline-sync");
```

Then, you can use the `question` method to ask the user for input:

Here's a simple example that demonstrates how to use `readline-sync`:

```javascript
const readlineSync = require("readline-sync");

// Ask user for their name
let name = readlineSync.question("What is your name? ");

console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
```

When the above code is run, it will wait for the user to input their name, and once they press Enter, it will display a greeting with the entered name

## Features

**Basic input** : `readline-sync` allows you to ask the user for input and store it in a variable. The input can be a string, a number, or a boolean value.

Get input from the user with the question method.

**Password Input**: You can hide input with the `question` method by using the `{ hideEchoBack: true }` option, which is useful for password prompts.

**Multiple Choice**: `readline-sync` provides a `keyInSelect` method which allows users to choose from a list of options.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages:

- Simple and intuitive API.
- Synchronous nature makes it easier for beginners to understand and use.

### Disadvantages:

- Blocking the event loop can be inefficient for applications that require high concurrency.
- Not suitable for real-world web applications; more suited for small scripts or CLI tools.

## Conclusion

`readline-sync` is a handy tool for simple command-line interactions in Node.js. While it's not recommended for production-level applications due to its synchronous nature, it's perfect for quick scripts or learning purposes.

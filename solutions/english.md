Well, I didn´t know that much about the subjunctive and learned about my mistakes. Also it was a lot of fun.

in my opinion it's more important to learn vocabulary and get a "feeling" for words, what they mean in sometimes deveating.. let's say.. content.. see? can´t seeto find ANY words today. Therefore Iḿ happy to be here to improve my expressional skills. Oh, and itś fun, too
dyslexic also, sorry: can't SEEM to find any words

Dear Elizabeth, thank you very much indeed for your choice of topic to discuss about, I enjoyed it veeeery much! <3

Dear Conrad, thank you very much ineed for an entire hour of sheer joy!
i DID love your humorous approach to (correct preposition? sigh..) teaching and  appreciated every single second. Thanks!

Thank you very much indeed for that great lesson on interesting topics, your very kind and encouraging way of teaching!


Dear Duduzile, thank you very much indeed for your patience i.e. with my clumsiness - and your very encouraging approach to teaching! Quite a privilege to have been your pupil today. Have a nice weekend!

Dear Shelley, thank you very much indeed for an entire hour of inspiration (and fun, too) conveyed by you. WE as a class agreed, that every single second was the epitome of sheer joy.
On a personal note: once i have matured - which will never happen, obviously - i would like to aspire for a similar.. what's the term.. life design, once i can afford it. A true pleasure today to have had the privilege of encountering you. <3

Dear Edward, thank you very much indeed for an entire hour of inspiration conveyed by you.
Being a politics addict i would have loooved to have an extensive educated discussion with you for hours. What's your take on "silicon curtain"?. What is your impression of German politics, do you see any propaganda at work?... Well, "educated" concerning you - me clumsily stuttering, struggling for words again, in my beloved language English <3. It´s so great to have the opportunity to meet very educated, intelligent, inspiring people like you. Despite being tired before your lesson - you certainly managed to make me feel wide awake. Therefore, from the bottom of my heart, have a terrific weekend and a magnificent barbecue with your friends!

Dear Jesse, thank you very much indeed of hartelijk bedankt voor een heele uur of pure joy and fun. 't was een echt groote plezier to have had the privilege of encountering you and have some very inspiring topics to talk about. Wacht even.. ik denk je bent de deerde South African teacher we have had the privilege to encounter. I must confess: i rather know something close to NOTHING about SA, e.g. don't know whether it's appropriate to speak in nederlands which should be close to afrikaans. Or if using it is considered to be racist in itself. Hopefully not. i just happen to live close to the dutch border, daarom weet ik een paar woorden.
Thank you for a "Fun Friday" with your "top shelf" lesson!
